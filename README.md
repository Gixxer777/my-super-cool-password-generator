# My Super Cool Password Generator

## Description

This website was built to showcase an example of a secure password generating application with the password generation being written in Javascript. The website is compatible with multiple screen sizes. During this project I was able to apply what I learned about Javascript to use it in a real world situation.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the website, click on the "Generate Password" button. At the top of the screen you will be given a prompt for the selection of what criteria you want for your password as far as a length between 8 and 128 characters, lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numbers, and special characters. When you have successfully given answers to the prompts, your password will be displayed in the password box for you to copy. If you answer with less than 8 or more than 128 characters or you click cancel when you are making the decision for password length you will get alerts that give you directions on how to properly answer the question within the specified guidelines.
